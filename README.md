# Ethereum Block Explorer


Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:
  * the blockchain network itself
  * blocks in the blockchain
  * transactions in a block
  * accounts
  * and many other things
  

## Getting Started

Clone this project to pull down some basic starter code.

After that cd into the base directory of the project and run `npm install` to download all the project dependencies.

In this project i chose to use React for a front-end and added minimal front-end code to get me going.
